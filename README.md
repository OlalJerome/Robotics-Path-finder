## **🔹 Overview**
This project implements a **path counting algorithm** that determines the number of valid paths between two points **A (Start)** and **B (Goal)** in a **grid-based environment with obstacles**. It uses a **recursive backtracking approach with memoization** to explore all possible paths.  

### **💡 Applications**
As a **robotics engineer**, this algorithm is applicable in:  
✅ **Surgical Robotics:** Optimizing robotic arm navigation inside the human body, avoiding critical structures.  
✅ **Autonomous Navigation:** Used in mobile robots, drones, and AGVs (Automated Guided Vehicles) to compute viable paths in dynamic environments.  
✅ **Industrial Automation:** Helps robotic arms move efficiently in constrained environments like warehouses and assembly lines.  
✅ **Artificial Intelligence & Game Development:** AI-controlled characters use pathfinding algorithms to move through obstacles efficiently.

## **🛠 Implementation**
The program processes a **grid-based environment** where:  
- `"A"` marks the **start point**.  
- `"B"` marks the **destination**.  
- `"x"` represents **blocked cells** (obstacles).  
- `"."` represents **open paths**.  
- The algorithm **explores all valid paths** using **recursion and memoization**.  

### **Example Grid Input**
```
A . . .
. . . .
. . . .
. . x B
```
This grid has **one starting point ("A")**, one **goal ("B")**, and an obstacle (`"x"`) blocking part of the path.

## **📌 How to Run the Code**
### **1️⃣ Install Python**
Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed.  

### **2️⃣ Run the Script**
Save the script as `count_paths.py`, then execute it in the terminal:
```sh
python count_paths.py
```
**Expected Output:**
```sh
The number of paths will be: X
```
Where `X` is the total number of valid paths from **A** to **B** while avoiding obstacles.

## **🚀 Future Enhancements**
🔹 Implement **A* or Dijkstra’s Algorithm** for optimal pathfinding.  
🔹 Expand for **dynamic environments**, where obstacles change over time.  
🔹 Integrate with **ROS (Robot Operating System)** for real-time path planning in robotic applications.  
🔹 Develop a **visualization tool** to show pathfinding steps dynamically.

Would you like me to help you **create a visualization tool** to demonstrate the paths dynamically using Python (`matplotlib` or `pygame`)? 🚀
